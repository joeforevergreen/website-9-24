            <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am an 18-year-old entrepreneur and multi-instrumentalist studying at the University of Pittsburgh. I wanted to make this website as a place for me to track my own education, career, and hobbies.</p>

        <p>I've been surrounded by music my entire life, and I've recently found pleasure in learning new instruments and genres. I am a classically trained cellist, I am the drummer in the UPJ Jazz Ensemble, I have studio bass guitar experience, and I am currently teaching myself the piano. I have also studied music theory and taught music lessons professionally. I hope to use this website to showcase my progress as a young musician.</p>

        <p>Forevergreen is a project that I helped start with my brother, Jack Pearson, and very close friend, Zack Yardley. My goal with the project is to help educate Americans on climate change topics. Being an entrepreneur is an extremely unique thing, and it continues to be a great source of learning for me.</p>
